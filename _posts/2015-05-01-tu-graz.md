description: At TU Graz we have been using Opencast since 2014. We have developed a custom video portal to provide access to lecture videos along with event and miscellaneous videos. The latest additions are a live streaming feature (utilising the user management system of Opencast for authentication), as well as video delivery via HTTP and adaptive streaming using the Wowza Media Engine in conjunction with Opencast.
