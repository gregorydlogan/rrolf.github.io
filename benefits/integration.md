## Compliance with Standards
One of the main goals within the development of Opencast is to play with other campus systems. The best way to achieve this is to use existing standards whenever possible. Using standards also will prevent a lock-in for adopters as most software is at least capable of importing such data.

### Dublin Core
Metadata for recordings in Opencast is stored in the Dublin Core XML standard. This standard is very established in several IT systems, especially in library and archiving systems.

### MPEG-7
Additional media dependent metadata is stored in the MPEG-7 standard. This includes for example the segments within a recording and the text that has been extracted with OCR from the slides.

### LTI
Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a very well established standard to include external content into a Learning Management System (LMS) like Sakai, Moodle, Illias or Blackboard. Opencast offers a LTI 1.1 interface.

### OAI-PMH
Open Archives Initiative â€“ Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a well established protocol for metadata harvesting. With such an interface library software i.e. can import metadata from external systems and index it. Opencast offers an OAI-PMH export.

### iCalendar
iCalendar is used for the scheduling of capture devices. This has the benefit, that developers of new capture agents can use default libraries to parse the schedule on their devices. Additionally administrators can for example import the schedules into a calendar software of their choice to get a better overview of their recordings.

### REST
Nearly all functionality of Opencast is provided over REST (Representational State Transfer) interfaces. That allows other developers to integrate Opencast services with their own software. So it would for example be possible to add an additional uploader for new video files into your LMS or integrate the scheduling with your room booking system.
