## Community developed Software
Opencast is developed by universities to efficiently manage academic video. The actual development process is driven by committers, with contributors, institutional leads, the community, and the Opencast Board providing direction and support.Major releases come out twice a year, one over the summer and one in winter to coincide with subsequent semesters; additional maintenance releases increasing stability are coming out frequently.

Typically the last 2 major releases will be maintained, but there may be exceptions, if volunteers within the community port back bug fixes to older releases, as they still use an older version.
The community provides support to new adopters and savvy users on a number of responsive and helpful mailing lists and an IRC channel for instant hints and solutions to problems that users might encounter. Additional to this, there are commercial partners offering support services.

As Opencast is open source software, there are several institutional branches with adaptations of Opencast to their needs. Several of these branches are publicly available, so that other institutions would be able to re-use these changes, if they fit their needs.
