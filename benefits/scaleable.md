title: Built to Scale
date:
description: Every institution is different and Opencast is built to handle a wide variety of needs. Our software can be built on almost any server infrastructure. A small college will be fine with a single server setup, while other institutions need multiple servers working together to serve more than a thousand recordings each week.

## From a single server to a large cluster
While every academic institutions will feel the need to manage video assets these days, individual requirements will be very different: Many universities have a strong focus on lecture capture, others are dealing with video content produced by students and/or academic staff â€“ or legacy video to merely archive and distribute upon demand. While some are dealing with several hundreds of videos, others are facing thousands of new videos per semester produced in hundreds of lecture halls each day. Some consider these ephemeral, some archive content for good.

Opencast has given proof of its ability to support any of these use cases: Stemming from a one-server installation, many institutions soon felt the need to move Opencast to a typical three-server-deployment with admin, worker, and engage to serve different purposes. These distributed deployments then could be scaled according to institutional needs to provide more encoding performance and/or a distribution end serving thousands of videos. Which could either be hosted at your institution or performing in the cloud.

The same scalability and flexibility can be found with the hardware you need in your classroom: Recordings devices working with Opencast range from a Linux-based PC with a capture card for less than 1,000$ to a multiple Full-HD recording device for 10k$. With Opencast providing the software to maintain and manage these, even if and especially when you have hundreds of them in your lecture halls.
